# Encapsulation.
The process of hiding a piece of data.

# Benefiis of Encasulating Data
1. To protect the particular data from being re-written.
2. To control what data other programmers have access to and what data they can edit.

To access a private variable you must create a method.
     getName(){
         return name
      }

newperson(); is used to create an instance. constructor is the first method that gets called. must have the same name as the class.
default constructor has no argument
